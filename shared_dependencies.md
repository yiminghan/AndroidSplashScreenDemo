1. HTML Elements IDs: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that can be used in CSS and JavaScript to manipulate or style the elements. For example, "header", "main", "footer" for the main layout of the website.

2. CSS Classes: These are identifiers that can be used to style multiple HTML elements in the same way. For example, "container", "text-center", "bg-dark" for styling purposes.

3. Tailwind CSS Classes: These are utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling. For example, "text-white", "bg-black", "p-4" for styling the website according to the design requirements.

4. HTML Elements Names: These are names given to form elements that can be used to retrieve user input. For example, "name", "email", "message" for a contact form.

5. CSS Selectors: These are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. For example, "#header", ".container", "h1" for styling specific elements.

6. External CSS File: The "styles.css" file will be shared across the HTML file for styling purposes.

7. External Tailwind CSS File: The "tailwind.css" file will be shared across the HTML file for utility-based styling.

8. Data Schemas: Although not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, if the website includes a form or any user input, there would be a shared data schema for that input. For example, a contact form might have a schema like {name: string, email: string, message: string}.

Note: As the prompt does not mention any JavaScript or message names, these are not included in the shared dependencies.
